Weather_Predication-
A machine learning project focused on predicting weather conditions based on historical data, including features like date, precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing various machine learning models to forecast weather patterns.

WeatherPredML is a machine learning project designed to predict weather conditions based on historical weather data. This project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Data Preprocessing:- Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. The following steps were taken:

Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset were identified and appropriately handled. Feature Engineering: Derived features were created based on the existing data to enhance model performance. Encoding Categorical Variables: The categorical feature weather was encoded to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. Scaling: Features were scaled to ensure uniformity and improve model convergence.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-

Univariate Analysis Univariate analysis was conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of individual features. Key insights were gained about the range and central tendency of the data.

Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis Bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed to explore relationships between different features and the target variable. Correlation matrices and pair plots were used to visualize these relationships.

Modeling The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets, and the following models were trained:

Logistic Regression Logistic Regression was used as a baseline model to predict the weather condition. It provided a good starting point for understanding the impact of various features.

Random Forest A Random Forest classifier was implemented to capture non-linear relationships in the data. It also provided feature importance, which was used to further refine the model.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) SVM was employed to classify weather conditions with high-dimensional feature space. Both linear and non-linear kernels were experimented with to achieve optimal performance.

Model Evaluation The performance of each model was evaluated using confusion metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
